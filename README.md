-------------------------------------
USAGE
-------------------------------------

1. Load images with the “File” menu button at the top left.
2. Drag control points around in an attempt to match features on each image.
	A. The more control points edited correctly, the more accurate the
	   morph will be
	B. Change grid size by using the “Grid Size” menu item
		i. 5x5, 10x10, 20x20 options
		ii. Warning: this removes images and resets completely
3. After each image is loaded and points manipulated, click “Preview”
   to view the morph.
	A. If you want to export each frame as a .jpeg image,
	   then check the “export images” checkbox.
	B. If you’d like to adjust the brightness of each image before
	   the morph happens, use the < > buttons under each image.
